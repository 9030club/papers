      "answer": "The paper raises several concerns and limitations. Firstly, it highlights the potential overstatement of reinforcement learning (RL) benefits, as some reported improvements might be noise rather than statistically significant gains. Additionally, the paper notes biases in GRPO, such as response-length and difficulty-level biases, which can lead to inefficient training and unnecessary long answers.

But you might have noticed that reactions to these releases were relatively muted. Why? One reason could be that GPT-4.5 and Llama 4 remain conventional models, which means they were trained without explicit reinforcement learning for reasoning.\n\nMeanwhile, competitors such as xAI and Anthropic have added more reasoning capabilities and features into their models. For instance, both the xAI Grok and Anthropic Claude interfaces now include a \"thinking\" (or \"extended thinking\") button for certain models that explicitly toggles reasoning capabilities.\n\nIn any case, the muted response to GPT-4.5 and Llama 4 (non-reasoning) models suggests we are approaching the limits of what scaling model size and data alone can achieve.\n\nHowever, OpenAI's recent release of the o3 reasoning model demonstrates there is still considerable room for improvement when investing compute strategically, specifically via reinforcement learning methods tailored for reasoning tasks. (According to OpenAI staff during the recent livestream, o3 used 10× more training compute compared to o1.)\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nSource: OpenAI livestream (https://openai.com/live/) on April 16, 2025\n\nWhile reasoning alone isn't a silver bullet, it reliably improves model accuracy and problem-solving capabilities on challenging tasks (so far). And I expect reasoningfocused post-training to become standard practice in future LLM pipelines.\n\nSo, in this article, let's explore the latest developments in reasoning via reinforcement learning."

      "content": "# Understanding reasoning models\n\nThe big elephant in the room is, of course, the definition of reasoning. In short, reasoning is about inference and training techniques that make LLMs better at handling complex tasks.\n\nTo provide a bit more detail on how this is achieved (so far), I'd like to define reasoning as follows:\n\nReasoning, in the context of LLMs, refers to the model's ability to produce intermediate steps before providing a final answer. This is a process that is often described as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. In CoT reasoning, the LLM explicitly generates a structured sequence of statements or computations that illustrate how it arrives at its conclusion.\n\nAnd below is a figure along with the definition.\n\nA simplified illustration of how an LLM might tackle a multi-step reasoning task. Rather than just recalling a fact, the model needs to combine several intermediate reasoning steps to arrive at the correct conclusion. The intermediate reasoning steps may or may not be shown to the user, depending on the implementation.\n\nIf you are new to reasoning models and would like a more comprehensive introduction, I recommend my previous articles:"

In this article, I finally want to take a closer look at the training methods.\n\n## RLHF basics: where it all started\n\nThe reinforcement learning (RL) training methods used to build and improve reasoning models are more or less related to the reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) methodology that is used to develop and align conventional LLMs. So, I want to start with a small recap of how RLHF works before discussing reasoning-specific modification based on RL-based training.\n\n## 2. Supervised fine-tuning\n## 3. Alignment (typically via RLHF)\n\nThe \"original\" LLM alignment method is RLHF, which is part of the standard repertoire when developing LLMs following the InstructGPT paper, which described the recipe that was used to develop the first ChatGPT model.\n\nThe original goal of RLHF is to align LLMs with human preferences. For instance, suppose you use an LLM multiple times where the LLM generates multiple answers for a given prompt. RLHF guides the LLM towards generating more of the style of answer that you prefer. (Often, RLHF is also used to safety-tune LLMs: to avoid sharing sensitive information, using swear words, and so on.)\n\nIf you are new to RLHF, here is an excerpt from a talk I gave a few years ago that explains RLHF in less than 5 minutes:\n\n## Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) in 4 minutes\n\nAlternatively, the paragraphs below describe RLHF in text form.\n\nThen, RLHF further aligns the LLM using an algorithm called proximal policy optimization (PPO). (Note that there are other algorithms that can be used instead of PPO; I was specifically saying PPO because that's what was originally used in RLHF and is still the most popular one today.)\n\n## For simplicity, we will look at the RLHF pipeline in three separate steps:\n\n- RLHF Step 1 (prerequisite): Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained model\n- RLHF Step 2: Creating a reward model\n- RLHF Step 3: Fine-tuning via proximal policy optimization (PPO)\n\nRLHF Step 1, shown below, is a supervised fine-tuning step to create the base model for further RLHF fine-tuning.\n\nIn RLHF step 1, we create or sample prompts (from a database, for example) and ask humans to write good-quality responses. We then use this dataset to finetune the pre-trained base model in a supervised fashion. As mentioned before, this is not technically part of RL training but merely a prerequisite.\n\nAs depicted in the figure above, for each prompt, we generate four responses from the fine-tuned LLM created in the prior step. Human annotators then rank these responses based on their preferences. Although this ranking process is time-consuming, it might be somewhat less labor-intensive than creating the dataset for supervised fine-tuning. This is because ranking responses is likely simpler than writing them.\n\nUpon compiling a dataset with these rankings, we can design a reward model that outputs a reward score for the optimization subsequent stage in RLHF Step 3. The idea here is that the reward model replaces and automates the laborintensive human ranking to make the training feasible on large datasets.\n\nThis reward model (RM) generally originates from the LLM created in the prior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) step. To turn the model from RLHF Step 1 into a reward model, its output layer (the next-token classification layer) is substituted with a regression layer, which features a single output node.\n\nThe third step in the RLHF pipeline is to use the reward model (RM) to fine-tune the previous model from supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is illustrated in the\n\nIn RLHF Step 3, the final stage, we are now updating the SFT model using proximal policy optimization (PPO) based on the reward scores from the reward model we created in RLHF Step 2.\n\nAhead of AI is a reader-supported publication.

      "content": "# A brief introduction to PPO: RL's workhorse algorithm\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the original RLHF method uses a reinforcement learning algorithm called proximal policy optimization (PPO).\n\nPPO was developed to improve the stability and efficiency of training a policy. (In reinforcement learning, \"policy\" just means the model we want to train; in this case, policy = LLM.)\n\ntraining.\n\nOn top of that, PPO also includes a KL divergence penalty in the loss. This term compares the current policy (the model being trained) to the original SFT model. This encourages the updates to stay reasonably close. The idea is to preferencetune the model, not to completely re-train, after all.\n\nThis is where the \"proximal\" in proximal policy optimization comes from: the algorithm tries to keep the updates close to the existing model while still allowing for improvement. And to encourage a bit of exploration, PPO also adds an entropy bonus, which this encourages the model to vary the outputs during training.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, I want to introduce some more terminology to illustrate PPO on a relatively high level. Still, there's a lot of jargon involved, so I tried to summarize the key terminology in the figure below before we continue.\n\nIllustration of the key terms in RLHF. For instance, several models are involved in PPO, where PPO is an algorithm used in RLHF (and RLHF is one of the most popular LLM alignment methods).\n\nBelow, I aim to illustrate the key steps in PPO via pseudo-code.\nIn addition, to make it more intuitive, I will also use an analogy: Imagine you are a chef running a small food delivery service. And you are constantly trying out new recipe variations to improve customer satisfaction. Your overall goal is to tweak your recipe (policy) based on customer feedback (reward).\n\n## 1. Compute the ratio of the next-token probabilities from the new vs the old policy:\n```\nratio = new_policy_prob / old_policy_prob\n```\n\nyet. We are using the current version of the policy (i.e., the model we are in the middle of training). However, it's a convention to call it \"new\". So, even though you're still experimenting, we call your current draft the \"new policy\" as per convention."

      "content": "# 2. Multiply that ratio by how good the action was (called the advantage):\n\n```\nraw_score = ratio * advantage\n```\n\n## Here, for simplicity, we may assume the advantage is computed based on the reward signal:\nadvantage = actual_reward - expected_reward\n\n## In the chef analogy, we can think of the advantage as how well the new dish performed:\nadvantage = customer_rating - expected_rating\n\nFor example, if a customer rates the new dish with a 9/10, and the customers normally give us a $7 / 10$, that's a +2 advantage.\n\nNote that this is a simplification. In reality, this involves generalized advantage estimation (GAE), which I am omitting here so as not to bloat the article further. However, one important detail to mention is that the expected reward is computed by a so-called \"critic\" (sometimes also called \"value model\"), and a reward model computes the actual reward. I.e., the advantage computation involves 2 other models, typically the same size as the original model we are finetuning.\n\nmodel is the actual customer then who gives the feedback (i.e., the actual reward)."

      "title": "3. Compute a clipped score:",
      "content": "# 3. Compute a clipped score:\n\nIf the new policy changes too much (e.g., ratio > 1.2 or $<0.8$ ), we clip the ratio, as follows:\n\n```\nclipped_ratio = clamp(ratio, 0.8, 1.2)\nclipped_score = clipped_ratio * advantage\n```\n\nIn the analogy, imagine that the new recipe got an exceptionally great (or bad) review. We might be tempted to overhaul the entire menu now. But that's risky. So, instead, we clip how much our recipe can change for now. (For instance, maybe we made the dish much spicier, and that one customer happened to love spicy food, but that doesn't mean everyone else will.)\n\n## 4. Then we use the smaller of the raw score and clipped score:\n\n```\nif advantage >= 0:\nfinal_score = min(raw_score, clipped_score)\nelse:\nfinal_score = max(raw_score, clipped_score)\n```\n\nAgain, this is related to being a bit cautious. For instance, if the advantage is positive (the new behavior is better), we cap the reward. That's because we don't want to over-trust a good result that might be a coincidence or luck.\n\nIf the advantage is negative (the new behavior is worse), we limit the penalty. The idea here is similar. Namely, we don't want to overreact to one bad result unless we are really sure.\n\nIn the analogy, this ensures that if a recipe is doing better than expected, we don't over-reward it unless we are confident. And if it's underperforming, we don't over-penalize it unless it's consistently bad."

In addition, we also add a KL penalty term, where $\\beta$ is a hyperparameter for the penalty strength:\nloss = -final_score $+\\beta$ * KL(new_policy || reference_policy)\n\nIn the analogy, we add the penalty to ensure new recipes are not too different from our original style. This prevents you from \"reinventing the kitchen\" every week. For example, we don't want to turn an Italian restaurant into a BBQ place all of a sudden.\n\nThis was a lot of information, so I summarized it with a concrete, numeric example in an LLM context via the figure below. But please feel free to skip it if it's too complicated; you should be able to follow the rest of the article just fine.\n\n## # AHEAD OF AI\n\n##\n\nThat being said, the main takeaways that will be relevant in the next section are that there are multiple models involved in PPO:\n\n## 1. The policy, which is the LLM that has been trained with SFT and that we want to further align).\n2. The reward model, which is a model that has been trained to predict the reward (see RLHF step 2).\n## 3. The critic, which is a trainable model that estimates the reward.\n4. A reference model (original policy) that we use to make sure that the policy doesn't deviate too much.\n\nBy the way, you might wonder why we need both a reward model and a critic model. The reward model is usually trained before training the policy with PPO. It's to automate the preference labeling by human judges, and it gives the score for the complete responses generated by the policy LLM.\n\nThe critic, in contrast, judges partial responses. We use it to create the final response. While the reward model typically remains frozen, the critic model is updated during training to estimate the reward created by the reward model better.\n\nMore details about PPO are out of the scope of this article, but interested readers can find the mathematical details in these four papers that predate the InstructGPT paper:\n(1) Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning (2016) by Mnih, Badia, Mirza, Graves, Lillicrap, Harley, Silver, and Kavukcuoglu introduces policy gradient methods as an alternative to Q-learning in deep learning-based RL.\n(2) Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (2017) by Schulman, Wolski, Dhariwal, Radford, and Klimov presents a modified proximal policy-based reinforcement\n\n(3) Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences (2020) by Ziegler, Stiennon, Wu, Brown, Radford, Amodei, Christiano, Irving illustrates the concept of PPO and reward learning to pretrained language models including KL regularization to prevent the policy from diverging too far from natural language.\n(4) Learning to Summarize from Human Feedback (2022) by Stiennon, Ouyang, Wu, Ziegler, Lowe, Voss, Radford, Amodei, Christiano introduces the popular RLHF three-step procedure that was later also used in the InstructGPT paper."

This approach is called reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).\n\nAgain, it's worth emphasizing: In contrast to standard RLHF, RLVR bypasses the need for a reward model.\n\nSo, rather than learning what counts as a \"good\" answer from human-labeled examples, the model gets direct binary feedback (correct or wrong) from a deterministic tool, such as symbolic verifiers or rule-based tools. Think calculators for math problems or compilers for code generation.\n\nExample of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). The model is prompted to solve a math problem and produces an answer. Instead of using a learned reward model, a symbolic verifier (e.g., a calculator) checks the output and provides binary feedback based on correctness.\n\nOne motivation here is to avoid noisy or expensive human or learned rewards by using automatic correctness checks as supervision signals during RL. The other motivation is that by using \"cheap\" tools like calculators, we can replace the expensive reward model training and the reward model itself. Since the reward model is usually the whole pre-trained model (but with a regression head), RLVR is much more efficient.\n\nComparison of reinforcement learning setups in LLM training. Traditional RLHF with PPO uses both a reward model (trained on human preferences) and a critic (value model) to guide learning. GRPO eliminates the critic model. RLVR with GRPO goes a step further by also removing the reward model, relying instead on verifiable rewards from symbolic tools like calculators or compilers.\n\nIn the next section, I want to briefly go over the DeepSeek-R1 pipeline and discuss the different verifiable rewards that the DeepSeek team used."

Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.\n(2) Format rewards: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between '<think>' and '</think>' tags.\n\nI realize that the introduction (i.e., everything up to this point) turned out to be much longer than I expected. Nonetheless, I think that this lengthy introduction is perhaps necessary to put the following lessons into context.\n\nAfter going through a large number of recent papers on reasoning models last month, I have put together a summary of the most interesting ideas and insights in this section.

However, [4] demonstrated successful generalization by training models on logic puzzles. And models trained on logic puzzles also achieved strong performance in mathematical reasoning tasks. This is evidence for RL's ability to induce general reasoning behaviors independent of specific domain knowledge.\n\n## 5. Extensions to broader domains\n\nAs a follow-up to the section above, another interesting insight [11] is that reasoning capabilities can naturally extend beyond structured domains like math, code, and logic.\n\nModels successfully applied reasoning to areas including medicine, chemistry, psychology, economics, and education, leveraging generative soft-scoring methods to effectively handle free-form answers.\n\n## Notable next steps for reasoning models include:\n\n- Integrating existing reasoning models (e.g., o1, DeepSeek-R1) with capabilities such as external tool use and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG); the just-released o3 model from Open AI paves the way here\n- Speaking of tool-use and search, [9] showed that giving reasoning models the ability to search induces behaviors such as self-correction and robust generalization across benchmarks, despite minimal training datasets.\n\nBased on the hoops DeepSeek-R1 team went through in terms of maintaining the performance on knowledge-based tasks, I believe adding search abilities to\n\nThe fundamental claim behind DeepSeek-R1 (and R1-Zero) is that RLVR explicitly induces reasoning capabilities. However, recent findings [10] suggest that reasoning behaviors, including the \"Aha moment,\" might already be present in base models due to pre-training on extensive chain-of-thought data.\n\nMy recent comparisons between DeepSeek V3 base and R1 reinforce this observation, as the updated base model also demonstrates reasoning-like behaviors. For instance, the comparison between the original V3 and R1 models clearly shows the difference between a non-reasoning and a reasoning model:\n\n## However, this is no longer true when comparing the updated V3 base model to R1:\n\nAdditionally, [13] identified that self-reflection and self-correction behaviors emerge progressively throughout pre-training across various domains and model sizes. This further complicates the attribution of reasoning capabilities solely to RL methods.\n\nPerhaps the conclusion is that RL definitely turns simple base models into reasoning models. However, it's not the only way to induce or improve reasoning abilities. As the DeepSeek-R1 team showed, distillation also improves reasoning. And since distillation, in this paper, meant instruction fine-tuning on chain-ofthought data, it's likely that pre-training on data that includes chain-of-thought data induces these abilities as well. (As I explained in my book through hands-on code, pre-training and instruction fine-tuning are based on the same next-token prediction task and loss functions, after all.)"

Here, the authors showcase a multi-modal LLM trained with RL. Similar to DeepSeek-R1, they didn't use process reward models (PRMs) but employed verifiable rewards. A PRM is a type of reward model used in RL (especially in LLM training) that evaluates not just the final answer but also the reasoning steps that led to it.\n\nAnother key idea here is that scaling the context length (up to 128k tokens) helps the model plan, reflect, and self-correct during reasoning. So, in addition to the correctness reward that is similar to DeepSeek-R1 they also have a length reward. Specifically, they promote shorter correct responses, and incorrect long answers get penalized more.\n\nAnd they propose a method called long2short to distill these long-chain-ofthought skills into more efficient short-CoT models. (It does this by distilling shorter correct responses from the long-CoT model using methods like model merging, shortest rejection sampling, DPO, and a 2nd round of RL with stronger length penalties.)"

This kind of strategy wasn't hand-coded; the model figured it out on its own.\n\n(earlier) models like o1-ioi relied on handcrafted test-time strategies like clustering thousands of samples and reranking them, which required a lot of manual design and tuning.\n\nAnnotated figure from Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models, https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807"

Clip-higher: Increases the upper bound of the PPO clipping range to encourage exploration and prevent entropy collapse during training.\n2. Dynamic sampling: Improves training efficiency by filtering out prompts where all sampled responses are either always correct or always wrong.\n3. Token-level policy gradient loss: moves from sample-level to token-level loss calculation so that longer responses can have more influence on the gradient update.*\n\n* Standard GRPO uses a sample-level loss calculation. This involves first averaging the loss over the tokens for each sample and then averaging the loss over the samples. Since the samples have equal weight, the tokens in samples with longer responses may disproportionally contribute less to the overall loss. At the same time, researchers observed that longer responses often contain gibberish before the final answer, and this gibberish wouldn't be sufficiently penalized in the original GRPO sample-level loss calculation.\n\nreasoning models further with RL.\nSo, using the 1.5B DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen model, they find that with only 7000 training examples and a $\\$ 42$ compute budget, RL fine-tuning can lead to strong improvements. In this case, the improvements are enough to outperform OpenAI's o1-preview on the AIME24 math benchmark, for example.\n\n## Furthermore, there were 3 interesting learnings in that paper:\n\n1. Small LLMs can achieve fast reasoning improvements within the first 50-100 training steps using a compact, high-quality dataset. But the performance quickly drops if training continues too long, mainly due to length limits and output instability.\n2. Mixing easier and harder problems helps the model produce shorter, more stable responses early in training. However, performance still degrades over time.\n3. Using a cosine-shaped reward function helps control output length more effectively and improves training consistency. But this slightly reduces peak performance compared to standard accuracy-based rewards.\n\nThe ReSearch framework proposed in this paper extends the RL method from the DeepSeek-R1 paper to include search results as part of the reasoning process. The model learns when and how to search based on its ongoing reasoning chain, and it then uses the retrieved information for the next steps of reasoning.\n\nThis is all done without supervised data on reasoning steps. The researchers also show that this approach can lead to useful behaviors like self-correction and reflection, and that it generalizes well across multiple benchmarks despite being trained on just one dataset."

So the \"Aha moment\" might not be induced by RL, but instead inherited from pre-training. This challenges the idea that RL alone is what creates deep reasoning behaviors.\n\n## The paper also identifies two biases in GRPO:\n\n1. Response-length bias: GRPO divides the advantage by the length of the response. This makes long incorrect answers get smaller penalties, so the model learns to generate longer bad answers.\n2. Difficulty-level bias: GRPO also normalizes by the standard deviation of rewards for each question. Easy or hard questions (with low reward variance) get overweighted.\n\nTo fix this, the authors introduce Dr. GRPO, which is a modification of standard GRPO. Here, they get rid of the response length normalization in the advantage computation. Also, they get rid of the question-level standard deviation. This will result in more efficient training and fewer unnecessary long answers.

This paper provides a bit of a plot twist, saying that self-correction already appears earlier during pre-training.\n\nConcretely, by introducing deliberately flawed chains-of-thought into tasks, the authors measure whether models can identify and correct these errors. They find that both explicit and implicit forms of reflection emerge steadily throughout pretraining. This happens across many domains and model sizes. Even relatively early checkpoints show signs of self-correction, and the ability becomes stronger as pre-training compute increases.\n\nAs we all know by now, reasoning models often generate longer responses, which raises compute costs. Now, this new paper shows that this behavior comes from the RL training process, not from an actual need for long answers for better accuracy. The RL loss tends to favor longer responses when the model gets negative rewards, which I think explains the \"aha\" moments and longer chains of thought that arise from pure RL training.\nI.e., if the model gets a negative reward (i.e., the answer is wrong), the math behind PPO causes the average per-token loss becomes smaller when the response is longer. So, the model is indirectly encouraged to make its responses longer. This is true even if those extra tokens don't actually help solve the problem.\n\nWhat does the response length have to do with the loss? When the reward is negative, longer responses can dilute the penalty per individual token, which results in lower (i.e., better) loss values (even though the model is still getting the answer wrong).\n\nSo the model \"learns\" that longer responses reduce the punishment, even though they are not helping correctness.\n\n## However, it's important to emphasize that this analysis was done for PPO:\nOf note, our current analysis is not applicable to GRPO, and a precise analysis of such methods is left for future work.\n\nIn addition, the researchers show that a second round of RL (using just a few problems that are sometimes solvable) can shorten responses while preserving or even improving accuracy. This has big implications for deployment efficiency."
